## Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

Predicting heart disease is crucial for improving public health and prevention strategies. Leveraging data-driven systems for this purpose can significantly enhance research and reduce the prevalence of heart disease. Machine Learning plays a key role in this context by offering accurate predictions based on patient data.

In this project, we analyzed a heart disease dataset, performed comprehensive data processing, and trained various Machine Learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The models employed include:

- **Naive Bayes** (Scikit-learn)
- **Decision Trees** (Scikit-learn)
- **C4.5** (Scikit-learn)
- **Random Forest** (Scikit-learn)
- **Neural Network** (Keras)

Additionally, we utilized an ensemble method by combining these models with a Voting Classifier to improve prediction accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved was 95% with the Random Forest algorithm.

The dataset used for this analysis is available at: [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).
